Kaggle_biorespose
=================
This is my very first time working with a Kaggle competition data set. The original competition post is here, https://www.kaggle.com/c/bioresponse. I'm working on my Python coding skills so that I can eventually start working on more complex problems and data structures. Any suggestions and comments would be greatly appreciated.

Cheers,
Jon
